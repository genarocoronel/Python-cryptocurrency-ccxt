### MultiLanguage Support

The ccxt library is available in three different languages (more to come). One of the primary objectives for developers is to design *portable* code, so that a single-language user can read code in other languages and understand it easily. This helps the adoption of the library. The main goal is to provide a generalized, unified, consistent and robust interface to as many existing cryptocurrency exchanges as possible.

At first, all language-specific version were developed in parallel, but separately from each other. But when it became too hard to maintain and keep the code consistent among all supported languages we decided to switch to what we call a *master/copy* process. There is now a single master version in one language, that is JavaScript. Other language-specific versions are syntactically derived (transpiled, generated) from the master version. But it doesn't mean that you have to be a JS coder to contribute. The portability principle allows Python and PHP devs to effectively participate in developing the master version as well.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Builds are automated by the external CI service (we use TravisCI). They are executed on remote server and triggered by new commits / pull requests. A build consists of multiple sequential stages (described in the [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/.travis.yml) script):

1. Installing dependencies
2. Incrementing version number _(not triggered by pull requests)_
3. Generating transpiled sources and documentation from the master JavaScript source.
4. Running tests + collecting code coverage analytics
5. Sending coverage report to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io)
6. Pushing built files back to GitHub _(not triggered by pull requests)_
7. Pushing generated Wiki files back to a separate GitHub repo _(not triggered by pull requests)_

You can always execute build steps manually to make sure everything's work before commiting your changes to the server. Here's how you do that...

### 1. Installing Dependencies

You will need the latest version of `pandoc`, which supports the `--wrap=preserve` option. On OSX it is easily installed with `brew install pandoc` (will need `brew`). For other options see the [`Installing Pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) guide.

### 2. Incrementing Version Number (you won't need that)

The version number is sourced to JavaScript, Python and PHP from the main NPM package file `package.json`. When releasing, it is incremented by the standard `npm version patch` command. But you will not need that, as releases are fully automated by the CI service.

### 3. Generating Transpiled Sources And Documentation

Everything's done by the `npm run build` command. There is a custom utility script in the root of the repository, named `transpile.js` that derives versions in other languages from the master code. The script converts language syntax from JS to Python/PHP and it is itself written in JavaScript. The transpiler does its job by sequentially applying series of regexp substitutions to perform one-to-one (line-to-line) mapping from JS to other languages.

More details can be found in [Master/Slave Sources Structure And Coding Rules](https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#masterslave-sources-structure-and-coding-rules) (please read it prior hacking the actual source code).

### 4. Running tests + collecting code coverage analytics

Run the standard `npm test` command to see the test results and the code coverage analytics report — which is also available in HTML (see the generated `coverage` folder). This command requires `npm run build` executed first.

To speed up development process, you can use `npm run fasttest` command, which tests only the master `ccxt.js` file, and thus does not require the `npm run build` to be executed first. You can also pass a market name and an (optional) symbol, to test only a small subset of the code, which is like 100x faster than full test:

```bash
npm run fasttest kraken BTC/USD  # Will run only for the BTC/USD pair on Kraken exchange
```

Other languages can also be tested by running these scripts (they require `npm run build` to be executed prior):

```
python test.py
```
```
php -f test.php
```

They also accept a market id and a symbol as additional arguments (e.g. `python test.py kraken` or `python test.py kraken BTC/USD`).

## Master/Slave Sources Structure And Coding Rules

The ccxt library includes one single file per each language:

```shell
/ccxt/__init__.py  # slave Python-version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.es5.js       # slave JavaScript ES5 version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.js           # master JS ES6 version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.php          # slave PHP version of the ccxt library
```

Slave files and docs are partially-generated from the master `ccxt.js` file by the `npm run build` command.

The structure of the master/slave file can be outlined like this:

```
      +--------------------------+ ← beginning of file
h  /  |                          |
e  |  |  common stuff            |
a  |  |                          |  
d <   //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler comment is used to separate code blocks 
e  |  |                          |
r  |  |  base market class       |   above this first bold line all code is language-specific
   \  |                          |                    ↑
      //=========================+ ← first 'bold' horizontal ruler comment
   /  |                          |                    ↓
   |  |  derived market class A  |   below this line all code can be ported to other languages
   |  |                          |
b  |  //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler used to separate derived classes
o  |  |                          |
d <   |  derived market class B  |
y  |  |                          |
   |  //-------------------------+
   |  |                          |
   |  | ...                      |   above this line all code is transpileable
   \  |                          |                    ↑
      //=========================+ ← second 'bold' horizontal ruler comment
f  /  |                          |                    ↓
o  |  |  other code              |   below this second bold line all code is language-specific
o  |  |                          |
t <   //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler comment is used to separate code blocks 
e  |  |                          |   
r  |  |  other code              |   
   \  |                          |
      //-------------------------+ ← end of file
```

Key notes on the structure of the library file:

- thin ruler comments are there for code block separation
- bold ruler comments are there to separate language-specific base code from language-agnostic derived implementations
- bold rulers are marker hints for the transpiler to quickly find the code for conversion
- the second bold ruler and footer are optional

### Derived Market Classes

Below are key notes on how to keep the JS code transpileable:

- do not use language-specific code syntax sugar, even if you really want to
- unfold all maps and comprehensions to basic for-loops
- always use Python-style indentation, it is preserved as is for all languages
- always put a semicolon (`;`) at the end of each statement, as in PHP/C-style=
- all associative keys must be single-quoted strings everywhere (`array['good'], array.bad`)
- all local variables should be declared with `let` keyword
- do everything with base class methods only
- if you need another base method you will have to implement it in the base class in all three languages
- try to reduce syntax to basic one-liner statements
- multiple lines are ok, but you should avoid deep nesting with lots of brackets
- do not use conditional statements that are too complex
