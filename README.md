The list above is updated frequently, new crypto markets, altcoin exchanges, bug fixes, API endpoints are introduced and added on regular basis. If you don't find a cryptocurrency exchange market in the list above and/or want another market to be added, post or send us a link to it by opening an issue here on GitHub or via email.

The library is under MIT license, that means its absolutely free for any developer to build commercial and opensource software on top of it, but use it as is at your own risk with no warranties.

Developer team is open for collaboration and available for hiring and outsourcing. If you're interested in integrating this software into an existing project or in developing new opensource and commercial projects we welcome you to read our [Public Offer](#public-offer).

## Installation

This library is shipped as a single-file (all-in-one module) implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements.

The main file is:
- `ccxt.js` in JavaScript ([ccxt for Node.js](http://npmjs.com/package/ccxt) and web browsers)
- `ccxt/__init__.py` in Python (works in both Python 2 and 3)
- `ccxt.php` in PHP

The easiest way to install the ccxt library is to use builtin package managers. 

You can also clone it directly into your project directory from GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.git
```

An alternative way of installing this library into your code is to copy a single `ccxt.*` file manually into your working directory with language extension appropriate for your environment. 

### Node.js (npm)

```shell
npm install ccxt
```

Node version of the ccxt library requires `crypto` and `node-fetch`, both of them are installed automatically by npm.

```JavaScript
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')
console.log (Object.keys (ccxt)) // print all available markets
```

### Python

```shell
pip install ccxt
```

Python version of the ccxt library does not require any additional dependencies and uses builtin modules only.

```Python
import ccxt
print dir (ccxt) # print a list of all available market classes
```

### PHP

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.git
```

The ccxt library in PHP requires common PHP modules:
- cURL
- mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
- PCRE
- iconv

```PHP
include "ccxt.php";
$market = new \cxxt\$id (); // $id is a string literal id of your desired exchange market
```

### Web Browsers

The ccxt library can also be used in web browser client-side JavaScript for various purposes. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt.git
```

The client-side JavaScript version also requires CryptoJS. Download and unpack [CryptoJS](https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/) into your working directory or clone [CryptoJS from GitHub](https://github.com/sytelus/CryptoJS).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sytelus/CryptoJS
```

Finally, add links to CryptoJS components and ccxt to your HTML page code:

```HTML
<script src="crypto-js/rollups/sha256.js"></script>
<script src="crypto-js/rollups/hmac-sha256.js"></script>
<script src="crypto-js/rollups/hmac-sha512.js"></script>
<script src="crypto-js/components/enc-base64-min.js"></script>
<script src="crypto-js/components/enc-utf16-min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="ccxt.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    // print all available markets
    document.addEventListener ('DOMContentLoaded', () => console.log (ccxt))
</script>
```

## Usage

### Intro

The ccxt library consists of a public part and a private part. Anyone can use the public part out-of-the-box immediately after installation. Public APIs open access to public information from all exchange markets without registering user accounts and without having API keys. 

Public APIs include the following: 
- market data
- instruments/trading pairs
- price feeds (exchange rates)
- order books
- trade history
- tickers
- OHLC(V) for charting
- other public endpoints

For trading with private API you need to obtain API keys from/to exchange markets. It often means registering with exchange markets and creating API keys with your account. Most exchanges require personal info or identification. Some kind of verification may be necessary as well. If you want to trade you need to register yourself, this library will not create accounts or API keys for you. Some exchange APIs expose interface methods for registering an account from within the code itself, but most of exchanges don't. You have to sign up and create API keys with their websites.

Private APIs allow the following:
- manage personal account info
- query account balances
- trade by making market and limit orders
- deposit and withdraw fiat and crypto funds
- query personal orders
- get ledger history
- transfer funds between accounts
- use merchant services

This library implements full public and private REST APIs for all exchanges. WebSocket and FIX implementations in JavaScript, PHP, Python and other languages coming soon.

The ccxt library supports both camelcase notation (preferred in JavaScript) and underscore notation (preferred in Python and PHP), therefore all methods can be called in either notation or coding style in any language.

```
// both of these notations work in JavaScript/Python/PHP
market.methodName ()  // camelcase pseudocode
market.method_name () // underscore pseudocode
```

### JavaScript

```JavaScript
'use strict';
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')

;(() => async function () {

    let kraken    = new ccxt.kraken ()
    let bitfinex  = new ccxt.bitfinex ({ verbose: true })
    let huobi     = new ccxt.huobi ()
    let okcoinusd = new ccxt.okcoinusd ({
        apiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
        secret: 'YOUR_SECRET_PRIVATE_KEY',
    })

    let krakenProducts = await kraken.loadProducts ()

    console.log (kraken.id,    krakenProducts)
    console.log (bitfinex.id,  await bitfinex.loadProducts  ())
    console.log (huobi.id,     await huobi.loadProducts ())

    console.log (kraken.id,    await kraken.fetchOrderBook (Object.keys (kraken.products)[0]))
    console.log (bitfinex.id,  await bitfinex.fetchTicker ('BTC/USD'))
    console.log (huobi.id,     await huobi.fetchTrades ('ETH/CNY'))

    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.fetchBalance ())

    // sell 1 BTC/USD for market price (create market sell order)
    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.sell ('BTC/USD', 1))

    // buy 1 BTC/USD for $2500 (create limit buy order) 
    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.buy ('BTC/USD', 1, 2500.00))

}) ()
```

### Python

```Python
# coding=utf-8

import ccxt

hitbtc = ccxt.hitbtc ({ verbose: true })
bitmex = ccxt.bitmex ()
huobi  = ccxt.huobi ()
exmo   = ccxt.exmo ({
    'apiKey': 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
    'secret': 'YOUR_SECRET_PRIVATE_KEY',
})

hitbtc_products = hitbtc.load_products ()

print (hitbtc.id, hitbtc_products)
print (bitmex.id, bitmex.load_products ())
print (huobi.id,  huobi.load_products ())

print (hitbtc.fetch_order_book (hitbtc_products.keys ()[0]))
print (bitmex.fetch_ticker ('BTC/USD'))
print (huobi.fetch_trades ('ETH/CNY'))

print (exmo.fetch_balance ())
```

### PHP

```PHP
include 'ccxt.php';

$poloniex = new \ccxt\poloniex  ();
$bittrex  = new \ccxt\bittrex   (array ('verbose' => true));
$zaif     = new \ccxt\zaif      ();
$quoine   = new \ccxt\quoine    (array (
    'apiKey' => 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
    'secret' => 'YOUR_SECRET_PRIVATE_KEY',
));

$poloniex_products = $poloniex->load_products ();

var_dump ($poloniex_products);
var_dump ($bittrex->load_products ());
var_dump ($quoine->load_products ());

var_dump ($poloniex->fetch_order_book (array_keys ($poloniex_products)[0]));
var_dump ($bittrex->fetch_trades ('BTC/USD'));
var_dump ($zaif->fetch_ticker ('BTC/JPY'));

var_dump ($quoine->fetch_balance ());
```
